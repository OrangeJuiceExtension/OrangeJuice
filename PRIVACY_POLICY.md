# Privacy Policy

Orange Juice does not collect, store, transmit, or sell any personal data.
* No analytics
* No tracking
* No telemetry
* No user accounts
* No third-party services

All functionality runs locally in your browser. Any data the extension uses (such as preferences or state) stays on your machine and is never sent anywhere.

If this ever changes, this policy file will be updated clearly and explicitly. Until then, there is nothing to opt out of, because nothing is collected in the first place.

If you have questions, feel free to open an issue on GitHub:
