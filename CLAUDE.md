Always follow these directions:
* Prefer for...of instead of forEach
* Clean up any resources that might leak when the context is invalidated
* Extract inline regex to a const
* Reduce unnecessary code duplication and excessive complexity
* Block statements are preferred: if (!stored) { return []; }
* Number.parseInt instead of parseInt
* Wrap tests in a top level describe()
