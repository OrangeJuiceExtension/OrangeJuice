		<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

		<div class="friendly-note">
			<strong>Hey there!</strong> Thanks for using Orange Juice. We've kept these terms simple
			and human-readable. The short version: use the extension as intended, don't expect us to
			be responsible if something goes wrong, and be nice.
		</div>

		<h2>What Orange Juice Does</h2>
		<p>
			Orange Juice is a free, open-source browser extension that enhances your Hacker News
			experience. It runs locally in your browser and doesn't collect any data about you
			(seriously, check our <a href="./privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>).
		</p>

		<h2>Using Orange Juice</h2>
		<p>By installing and using Orange Juice, you agree to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Use the extension responsibly and in accordance with Hacker News's own terms and
				guidelines
			</li>
			<li>Not modify the extension in ways that could harm others or violate any laws</li>
			<li>
				Understand that the extension is provided "as is" and we make no guarantees about
				its functionality
			</li>
			<li>
				Not hold us responsible if the extension doesn't work as expected or causes issues
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>No Warranties</h2>
		<p>
			Orange Juice is a hobby project maintained by volunteers. We do our best to make it work
			well, but we can't promise it'll be perfect. The extension is provided "as is" without
			any warranty of any kind, express or implied.
		</p>

		<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
		<p>
			We're not liable for any damages that might come from using Orange Juice. This includes
			(but isn't limited to) data loss, browser issues, or problems with your Hacker News
			account. Use at your own risk.
		</p>

		<h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
		<p>
			We might update these terms from time to time. If we make significant changes, we'll
			note them in the extension's release notes. By continuing to use Orange Juice after
			changes are made, you agree to the updated terms.
