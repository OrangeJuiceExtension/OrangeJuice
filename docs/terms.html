					<strong>Hey there!</strong>
					Thanks for using Orange Juice. We've kept these terms simple and human-readable.
					The short version: use the extension as intended, don't expect us to be
					responsible if something goes wrong, and be nice. We built Orange Juice because
					we love Hacker News and wanted to make it even better. We hope you enjoy using
					it as much as we enjoyed building it.
				</div>

				<h2>What Orange Juice Does</h2>
				<p>
					Orange Juice is a free, open-source browser extension that enhances your Hacker
					News experience. It runs locally in your browser and doesn't collect any data
					about you (seriously, check our <a href="./privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>).
				</p>

				<h2>Using Orange Juice</h2>
				<p>By installing and using Orange Juice, you agree to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Use the extension responsibly and in accordance with Hacker News's own terms
						and guidelines
					</li>
					<li>
						Not modify the extension in ways that could harm others or violate any laws
					</li>
					<li>
						Understand that the extension is provided "as is" and we make no guarantees
						about its functionality
					</li>
					<li>
						Not hold us responsible if the extension doesn't work as expected or causes
						issues
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>No Warranties</h2>
				<p>
					Orange Juice is a hobby project maintained by volunteers. We do our best to make
					it work well, but we can't promise it'll be perfect. The extension is provided
					"as is" without any warranty of any kind, express or implied.
				</p>

				<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
				<p>
					We're not liable for any damages that might come from using Orange Juice. This
					includes (but isn't limited to) data loss, browser issues, or problems with your
					Hacker News account. Use at your own risk.
				</p>

				<h2>Open Source</h2>
				<p>
					Orange Juice is open source and licensed under the GPLv3 License. You're free to
					fork it, modify it, and use it however you like, as long as you follow the
					license terms. Check out the code on
					<a
						href="https://github.com/OrangeJuiceExtension/OrangeJuice"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						>GitHub</a
					>.
				</p>

				<h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
				<p>
					We might update these terms from time to time. If we make significant changes,
					we'll note them in the extension's release notes. By continuing to use Orange
					Juice after changes are made, you agree to the updated terms.
				</p>

				<h2>Hacker News</h2>

					Orange Juice is an independent project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by,
					or sponsored by Hacker News or Y Combinator. Hacker News is a trademark of Y
					Combinator. When using Orange Juice, you're still subject to Hacker News's own
